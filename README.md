# WebForum
Web Forum to practice my web development skills.

Feel free to use any of the code here as you like.

Warning : The only security implemented for this forum is the encryption of passwords before they are saved to the database. There is no HTML encoding currently implemented using some form of htmlentities() to stop someone from running code through any of the inputs on the forms. If you plan to use any of the forms/modals that are in this code base I highly recommend you implement some form of HTML encoding before saving any of the information in your database.

For more information on how to do this : http://php.net/manual/en/function.htmlentities.php
